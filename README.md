# LUP decomposition
`lup-decomp` implements LUP decomposition for (non-singular) square matrices.
This is, for example, useful in solving systems of linear equations or
inverting matrices.

## Usage
**gauss-partial** A => lu p

Compute matrices L and U, along with row permutations vector p.
L is unit lower triangular. U is upper triangular. L and U are
stored compactly in the same matrix lu, with the diagonal of unit
elements of L omitted.

The relationship between A, L, U and P is P.A = L.U

The method is Gaussian elimination with partial (row) pivoting,
as described in [1].

```common-lisp
(let ((a #2A((2 0 2 3/5) (3 3 4 -2) (5 5 4 2) (-1 -2 17/5 -1))))
(gauss-partial a))
;;=> #2A((5 5 4 2) (2/5 -2 2/5 -1/5)
;;       (-1/5 1/2 4 -1/2) (3/5 0 2/5 -3))
;;   #(2 0 3 1)
```
